# Alarm System Fix - Task Deadline Reminders

## Problem Description
The original alarm system was playing the alarm sound repeatedly every time the countdown function ran for overdue tasks. This created a continuous, annoying sound that would play indefinitely as long as a task remained overdue.

## Solution Implemented
The alarm system has been modified to play the alarm sound **only once** when a task deadline is first reached, using localStorage to track which tasks have already triggered their alarms.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Modified `startSingleCountdown` function in `Frontend/script.js`**
- Added localStorage tracking for each task's alarm state
- Alarm only plays when `alarmPlayed` is false
- Once alarm plays, the state is saved to localStorage to prevent future plays

```javascript
// Track if alarm has already been played for this task using localStorage
const alarmKey = `alarm_played_${taskId}`;
const alarmPlayed = localStorage.getItem(alarmKey) === 'true';

// Play sound only once when deadline is first reached
if (!alarmPlayed) {
  const beep = document.getElementById('beepSound');
  if (beep) {
    beep.play().catch(e => console.log('Audio play failed:', e));
    // Mark this task's alarm as played in localStorage
    localStorage.setItem(alarmKey, 'true');
  }
}
```

### 2. **Added Alarm Reset Functions**
- `resetTaskAlarm(taskId)`: Reset alarm for a specific task
- `resetAllTaskAlarms()`: Reset all task alarms
- `testAlarmSound()`: Test the alarm sound functionality

### 3. **Automatic Alarm Reset on Task Status Changes**
- **Task Completed/Cancelled**: Alarm automatically resets when task status changes to completed or cancelled
- **New Task Assignment**: Alarm resets for newly assigned tasks
- **Task Updates**: Alarm resets when tasks are updated (in case due date changes)

### 4. **Enhanced User Interface**
- Added "Test Alarm" button to verify audio functionality
- Added "Reset All Alarms" button for testing purposes
- Added individual "Reset Alarm" buttons for overdue tasks
- Enhanced CSS styling for alarm control buttons

### 5. **Created Test Page**
- `Frontend/alarm-test.html`: Comprehensive test page to demonstrate alarm behavior
- Shows how alarms only play once per task
- Allows testing of alarm reset functionality
- Displays current alarm states in real-time

## How It Works Now

### **Alarm Triggering**
1. When a task deadline is reached, the countdown function checks if the alarm has already been played
2. If not played, the alarm sounds and the state is saved to localStorage
3. Future countdown updates for the same task will not trigger the alarm again

### **Alarm Reset Scenarios**
- **Manual Reset**: User clicks "Reset Alarm" button for individual tasks
- **Bulk Reset**: User clicks "Reset All Alarms" button
- **Automatic Reset**: Task is completed, cancelled, or updated
- **New Assignment**: New task is assigned to the user

### **Persistence**
- Alarm states are stored in localStorage with keys like `alarm_played_123`
- States persist across page refreshes and browser sessions
- States are automatically cleaned up when tasks are completed

## Files Modified

### **Frontend/script.js**
- Modified `startSingleCountdown` function
- Added alarm reset utility functions
- Added test alarm function

### **Frontend/dashboard-tasks.js**
- Modified `updateTaskStatus` function to reset alarms on completion
- Modified socket event handlers to reset alarms for new/updated tasks

### **Frontend/dashboard.html**
- Added test alarm and reset alarms buttons
- Enhanced deadline reminders section

### **Frontend/dashboard.css**
- Added styles for alarm control buttons
- Enhanced deadline item styling

### **Frontend/alarm-test.html**
- New comprehensive test page for alarm functionality

## Testing the Fix

### **1. Basic Functionality Test**
1. Open the dashboard and wait for a task to become overdue
2. Verify the alarm plays only once
3. Check that the alarm doesn't repeat on subsequent countdown updates

### **2. Reset Functionality Test**
1. Use the "Reset All Alarms" button
2. Wait for a task to become overdue again
3. Verify the alarm plays again

### **3. Individual Task Reset Test**
1. For overdue tasks, use the individual "Reset Alarm" button
2. Verify only that specific task's alarm can be triggered again

### **4. Test Page Verification**
1. Open `Frontend/alarm-test.html`
2. Test various countdown scenarios
3. Verify alarm behavior matches expected functionality

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **No More Annoying Repeated Alarms**: Alarms only play once per task deadline
2. **Better User Experience**: Users aren't bombarded with continuous sounds
3. **Maintains Functionality**: Important deadline notifications are still provided
4. **Flexible Reset Options**: Users can reset alarms for testing or re-notification
5. **Automatic Management**: Alarms automatically reset when tasks are completed
6. **Persistent State**: Alarm states survive page refreshes and browser restarts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sound Customization**: Allow users to choose different alarm sounds
2. **Volume Control**: Add volume settings for alarm sounds
3. **Notification Options**: Provide alternative notification methods (desktop notifications, email)
4. **Snooze Functionality**: Allow users to temporarily silence alarms
5. **Batch Operations**: Enable bulk alarm management for multiple tasks

## Troubleshooting

### **Alarm Not Playing**
1. Check browser audio permissions
2. Verify the audio file exists at `./alarm/beep-beep.mp3`
3. Check browser console for audio play errors
4. Ensure localStorage is enabled

### **Alarm Playing Multiple Times**
1. Check if `resetTaskAlarm` is being called unexpectedly
2. Verify localStorage keys are being set correctly
3. Check for multiple countdown intervals running simultaneously

### **Alarm State Not Persisting**
1. Check if localStorage is working in the browser
2. Verify the alarm key format matches: `alarm_played_${taskId}`
3. Check for localStorage quota issues

## Conclusion

The alarm system now provides a much better user experience by playing alerts only when necessary (when deadlines are first reached) while maintaining all the important functionality for deadline tracking. The system is robust, user-friendly, and automatically manages alarm states based on task lifecycle events.
