# 🚀 Netlify Frontend Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy the frontend of your Electrical Management System to Netlify while keeping the backend on Render.

## 🎯 Current Status
- ✅ **Backend**: Successfully deployed on Render
- ✅ **Frontend**: Ready for Netlify deployment
- ✅ **Configuration**: Updated for multi-environment support

## 📋 Prerequisites
1. GitHub account with your project repository
2. Netlify account (free tier available)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Frontend Files
Run the deployment script:
```bash
deploy-frontend.bat
```

This creates a `Frontend-deploy` folder ready for deployment.

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Drag & Drop (Quick)
1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Drag the `Frontend-deploy` folder to the deployment area
4. Wait for deployment to complete

#### Option B: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose GitHub as your Git provider
4. Select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `echo "Frontend ready"`
   - **Publish directory**: `Frontend-deploy`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Environment Detection
The frontend automatically detects its environment:
- **Development**: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- **Render**: `*.onrender.com`
- **Netlify**: `*.netlify.app` or `*.netlify.com`
- **Production**: Any other domain

### API Endpoints
All API calls automatically route to your Render backend:
- **Health Check**: `/health`
- **Authentication**: `/auth/*`
- **Inventory**: `/inventory/*`
- **Tasks**: `/tasks/*`
- **Admin**: `/admin/*`

## 🌐 URLs After Deployment

- **Frontend**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Backend API**: `https://electrical-management-system.onrender.com`

## ✅ Testing Your Deployment

1. **Frontend Load**: Visit your Netlify URL
2. **Configuration**: Check browser console for environment detection
3. **API Connection**: Try logging in (should connect to Render backend)
4. **Health Check**: Test `/health` endpoint

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Not Loading
- Check Netlify deployment logs
- Verify `Frontend-deploy` folder contents
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root

### API Connection Issues
- Verify backend is running on Render
- Check CORS configuration
- Test API endpoints directly

### Configuration Issues
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `config.js` is loading
- Check environment detection logic

## 📱 Features Available
